# Waiter Tips Prediction Model

![Waiter Image](https://img.icons8.com/dusk/64/waiter.png)

**Project Overview:**
- The "Waiter Tips Prediction Model" is a machine learning project that predicts the amount of tips a waiter can expect to receive based on various factors such as the total bill, customer gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size. 
- This model can assist waitstaff and restaurants in understanding and estimating tips.

**Project Statement:**
- The restaurant industry relies on waitstaff tips as a significant part of their income. However, predicting the amount of tips a waiter can expect remains a challenge due to various influencing factors, including the total bill, customer demographics, and dining specifics.
- The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts waiter tips, providing valuable insights for optimizing staffing, improving service quality, enhancing customer satisfaction, and making data-driven decisions that benefit both restaurants and waitstaff.
- By addressing this challenge, we seek to empower the hospitality industry with the ability to better understand tipping behavior and enhance operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and visualize the dataset using Pandas and Plotly to gain insights into factors affecting tips.
- **Machine Learning:** Train a Linear Regression model to predict tips based on selected features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the "Waiter Tips Prediction Model" on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Scikit-Learn

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raghavendranhp/waiter_tip_prediction.git
2.Install dependencies
3.Run the project

## Data Analysis
- Explore the dataset using Pandas to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Visualize data using Plotly to identify relationships between variables.

## Machine Learning
- Preprocess data by encoding categorical features and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Train a Linear Regression model to predict tips based on selected features.

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
- Understand the model's accuracy in predicting tips based on provided features.

## Business value
**Optimized Staffing Levels:**
- By accurately predicting tips, restaurants can schedule staff more efficiently, ensuring that the right number of waiters is available during peak times and reducing labor costs during slower periods.

**Customer Satisfaction Improvement:**
- The model can help identify factors that influence tipping behavior, enabling restaurants to focus on improving service quality, enhancing the overall dining experience, and increasing customer satisfaction.

**Revenue Maximization:** 
- Understanding the relationship between the total bill and tips can assist in pricing strategies, upselling, and menu item recommendations that can lead to higher check totals and, subsequently, larger tips.

**Performance Benchmarking:** 
- Restaurants can evaluate the performance of individual waitstaff by comparing predicted tips to actual tips received. 
- This can be used to reward high-performing employees and provide training or support to those who may need improvement.

**Customer Segmentation:** 
- The model can uncover patterns related to customer demographics and tipping behavior. 
- This information can be used for targeted marketing and personalized services to different customer segments.

**Data-Driven Decision-Making:** 
- The project promotes data-driven decision-making, allowing restaurants to make informed choices regarding pricing, menu selection, employee scheduling, and customer service improvements.

**Financial Planning:** 
- The ability to predict tips accurately can help restaurants with financial planning, including budgeting, forecasting, and ensuring sufficient funds to cover operational costs and salaries.

**Competitive Advantage:** 
- Restaurants can gain a competitive advantage by offering personalized dining experiences based on customer profiles and preferences, resulting in increased customer loyalty.

**Service Efficiency:** 
- The model can help identify bottlenecks in the dining process, allowing restaurants to streamline service and reduce waiting times, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potentially larger tips.

**Training and Improvement:**
- Waitstaff can use the insights from the model to understand which factors influence tips the most, helping them provide better service and enhance their earning potential.
